# Trees
Behavior of binary search, AVL and redBlack trees and comparative analysis between them.

# What is a tree?
Is a node-based data structure, which each node have a value stored and pointers to others two nodes, Left child  and Right child.
There are some rules that must be followed when building this structure:
  1. The left child's value is always less than its parent node's value.
  2. The right child's value is always greater than its parent node's value.
  3. The left and the right subtree each must also be a tree.
